Hello and Welcome!

Bootstrap has literally changed my web dev life!

However, there is a distinct lack of options with regards to coloring. I know you can add the colors through Sass, but as someone who likes simplicity and does not always have the option to use a compiler, that presents the problem of them not being available. As a teacher teaching Web Dev, I am also limited in what I can and can't achieve in the learning evironment.

So... I made this!

Its a small css file, 22kb, and including it AFTER the main bootstrap css file (CDN or included in your own project) it will extend the capabilites by a significant amount.

I have created the classes for backgrounds, texts, and borders. also a number of more colorful buttons.

As a side note, having watched my students work, I was drawn to one particular student, who will be known as ZA and the way they used pastels. I have added an additional block for these, as sometimes, you just want something a bit softer! - Thanks ZA, you know who you are!
